What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git hidden folder is created with multiple files in it. You need it to keep 
track of changes in the repository.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

You can only commit files in the staging area, not in the working directory. 
The new files and modifications in the staging area are not yet in the 
repository.
It provides flexibility by letting you choose which files you want to include in
a commit.
