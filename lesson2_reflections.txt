What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git hidden folder is created with multiple files in it. You need it to keep 
track of changes in the repository.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

You can only commit files in the staging area, not in the working directory. 
The new files and modifications in the staging area are not yet in the 
repository.
It provides flexibility by letting you choose which files you want to include in
a commit.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

You can only add to the staging area files relevant to that logical change.



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

When testing a new, experimental feature or in a more general case, when you
have multiple versions of the code. Branches would make switching between
versions much faster and easier.



How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They allow me to see each branch on a separate line, which is better than the
"git log --graph --oneline branch1 branch2 branch3" equivalent.



What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in 
the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches together makes a new commit which will be on the branch
we made the merge on. The previous commits of the merged commit are both the
last commit of the merged branch and the last commit of the brach we are
performing the merge on.
