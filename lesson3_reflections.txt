When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
 local?

When:
  - the project you are working on has multiple collaborators working from
   different computers
  - you want to have a backup of your repository on a remote server
  - when you want to share what you are working on with the world



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When you don't want to publish your changes, and group them to make more sense,
rather then send them one at a time. 
Also, maybe you are working on multiple branches and only want to push one of 
them.
